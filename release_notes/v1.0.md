# Version 1.0 (2017-09-28)

In release v1.0.0 of HyperContainer, we introduced several significant updates and fixed many bugs to make runV production ready. The featured updates include:

- runV Compatibility:
  - compatible with the most recent [1.0 of OCI runtime specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/releases/tag/v1.0.0);
  - compatible with the [latest CNCF containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd);
  - compatible with the latest Docker (17.06.1-ee and later).
- New hypervisor architectures support:
  - *xenpv* driver, with the latest Xen 4.9, we could launch runV with very minimal performance penalty (<5 % in most scenarios) on instance of Google GCE and other IaaS platform;
  - *kvmtool* driver brings the offical ARM support to runV.
- Feature update:
  - Pod level portmappings: allow configure port mappings in pod level, and dynamic update port mapping rules;  
  - Read-only rootfs: allows runV to launch with read-only rootfs;
  - support vhostuser network card for *qemu* driver, which enables the low latency network for scenarios such as NFV.
- Many other feature or test improvements, and many bug fix.

Thanks the contribution from Huawei, ZJU, ARM, Intel, Alibaba, and other individuals.
