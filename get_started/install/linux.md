## Requirements

- Hypervisor: at least one of
  - [Linux] QEMU 2.0 or later
  - [Linux] Xen 4.5 or later (for Xen support)

## Install

[the current version](../release_notes/latest.md) supports the following Linux distros:

- Ubuntu ( > 14.04 )
- CentOS/RHEL 7.x
- Fedora ( > 20 )
- Debian ( > 7.0 )

### curl-to-bash or tarball

To setup Hyper, simply run (after 0.4, the same package support both
  KVM and Xen)

    curl -sSL http://hypercontainer.io/install | bash

Don't like the "curl to bash" methods? Download [tarball here](http://hyper-install.s3.amazonaws.com/hyper-latest.tgz).

For CentOS/RHEL users, please use the pre-build RPMs

If you build Qemu from source, don't forget enable virtfs (`--enable-virtfs`) during configuration.
